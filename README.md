This was a group project for an NGO to save up the nirmal hindon river in Uttar Pradesh,India

## Motivation
The nirmal hindon is drying up fast and so to save it people have to be educated and made aware of this problem. This app serves as 
a stepping stone of knowledge for this rivers protection and conservation

## Features

for the user. The user can upload any images to the server of the work he performed to save the river. The admin can then give user
privilege to add the images. The user can like and share the images just like instagram
